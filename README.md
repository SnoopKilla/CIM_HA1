# Computer Intensive Methods in Mathematical Statistics - Home Assignment 1
## Introduction
This assignment consists in implementing a Sequential Importance Sampling algorithm to estimate the unknown state of an hidden Markov model describing the dynamics of a moving target. Details can be found [here](https://github.com/SnoopKilla/CIM_HA1/blob/main/Assignment.pdf).
The performance of the implemented algorithms is assessed on simulated data. The following figure shows the comparison between the estimated trajectory and the real (simulated) trajectory as well as the locations of the stations of the cellular network.
